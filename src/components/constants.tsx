          <b>Snoozed Sneeze (SNZ) </b>, is a <b>reactionary artist </b>from
          Mumbai, India. His work largely focuses on the <b>intangible </b> as
          he adopts and aborts various ways to communicate the same. Submerged
          within white lies, he finds his most honest moments as those spent{" "}
          <b>observing, absorbing and reacting </b>
          to the world through his art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once his prospects with architecture seemed limited by the form of
          design solutions necessary for the zeitgeist, he pivoted towards art
          for a more genuine and autonomous voice as a creator.{" "}
          <b>Scale, composition</b> and <b>materiality</b> informing his method,
          he transitioned to art through a few years of <b>mural-making</b> and{" "}
          <b>street art</b> along the <b>western coast</b> and a few{" "}
          <b>Himalayan valleys in India.</b> The{" "}
          <b>flame of democratizing art burned bright within him,</b> while he
          worked with NGOs in painting street art for{" "}
          <b>slum areas, local police headquarters</b>, as well as co-creating
          what was considered the <b>third longest street art in India</b> at
          the time in 2017 (300ft x 15ft) for Reliance at the Mumbai Metro rail
          yard.

          His visual vocabulary reflects various <b>gradients and textures from the
          vastness of seas, fields and valleys stippled with intricate forms of
          flowers, butterflies, birds and people. ‘Metamorphosis’</b>  and the
          <b>complete disintegration</b> that a butterfly goes through to merely exist
          for a short span of time nurtured SNZ’s curiosity as a child. He
          believes it offered him flexibility growing up in <b>disintegrating and
          reintegrating his conviction from time to time.</b>
        </p>
        {/* <p>
          Painting these walls as <b>massive canvasses</b> was fundamental to
          the <b>maturation</b> of SNZ’s art practice{" "}
          <b>without compromising his innocence</b> in confronting ideas in a
          playful manner. His <b>visual vocabulary</b> reflects various{" "}

          <b>people</b>. Since childhood, he was curious about{" "}
          <b>metamorphosis</b> and the <b>complete disintegration</b> that a
          butterfly goes through as it evolves from a pupa. It offered him
          flexibility growing up in{" "}

          In <b>July 2020</b> SNZ collected his first NFT by an artist named{" "}
          <b>NFN Kalyan</b> whom he credits for playing a pivotal role in his
          creative journey. Anticipating a <b>paradigm shift</b>, words such as{" "}
          <b>
            ambition, innovation, collaboration, autonomy, longevity,
            transparency
          </b>{" "}
          and such framed the foundation for the early conversation about{" "}
          <b>decentralized creation.</b> It was also when he adopted the
          pseudonym <b>‘Snoozed Sneeze’</b> as it is medically detrimental to
          snooze a sneeze - akin to <b>withholding truth</b>. Few other human
          reactions are as genuine than a sneeze. He longs for{" "}
          <b>honest discourse </b> through his work.

          <b>‘Time’ </b> plays an intriguing role in the overarching

          2021), <b>identifying ourselves </b> (<b>‘OG SUGGA’</b> September

          <b>‘Epigenetics’ </b>- April 2021) and{" "}
          <b>acknowledging our dissonance </b> as we spin up our webs of

          He finds human nature to be inevitably pendulous while we’re
          distracted by numerous tangential options, akin to a pendulum bob
          swinging in circular motion creating an illusion of forward momentum.
          In truth, we’re{" "}

        <p>
          Conviction leads to the <b>creation and inflation</b> of several

          Imprisoned by our freedom of choice, we repeat our mistakes, trade off
          the pain for a bit of pleasure, justifying it all as we run through
          our mind maze.
