          <b>Butterfly Bubble</b>, an <b>art</b> collection by the artist{" "}
          <b>Snoozed Sneeze</b> comprises <b>33 butterflies </b> within their
          respective bubbles, oblivious to their surroundings, each in a{" "}
          <b>24 x 24 pixel grid.</b> This genesis collection is tokenized
          completely on-chain and the artist invites you to take a leap of faith
          into the Butterfly Bubble ecosystem on the Ethereum blockchain (PoS).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each butterfly enables its collector to receive{" "}
          <b>future airdrops </b>
          which will be minted and stored under a separate collection on Inter
          Planetary File System <b>(IPFS)</b>. There will be a total of{" "}
          <b>13 airdrops</b> for each genesis butterfly over <b>8 years</b>.
          This would make them a <b>total of 14 butterflies per set </b>, each
          butterfly representing a day in the average
          <b> lifespan of a butterfly.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          With each airdrop, the <b>pixel grid </b> that the butterfly and
          bubble are created on <b>grows larger </b>, creating a more vivid and
          denser visual, <b>allegorizing the maturation of a butterfly</b>. The
          only prerequisite to receive these airdrops is for a collector to own
          a genesis butterfly.

          <b>Snoozed Sneeze (SNZ) </b>, is a <b>reactionary artist </b>from
          Mumbai, India. His work largely focuses on the <b>intangible </b> as
          he adopts and aborts various ways to communicate the same. Submerged
          within white lies, he finds his most honest moments as those spent{" "}
          <b>observing, absorbing and reacting </b>
          to the world through his art. Once his prospects with architecture
          seemed limited by the form of design solutions necessary for the
          zeitgeist, he pivoted towards art for a more genuine and autonomous
          voice as a creator. <b>Scale, composition</b> and <b>materiality</b>{" "}
          informing his method, he transitioned to art through a few years of{" "}
          <b>mural-making</b> and <b>street art</b> along the{" "}
          <b>western coast</b> and a few <b>Himalayan valleys in India.</b> The{" "}
          <b>flame of democratizing art burned bright within him.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          He worked for an NGO’s initiative called ‘Chal Rang De’ (translates to
          ‘Let us color’), painting <b>wall art in a slum area </b>
          and a <b>police headquarter </b> in Mumbai, as well as co-creating
          what was considered the{" "}
          <b>third longest street art in India at the time (300ft x 15ft) </b>
          for <b>Reliance </b> at the <b>Mumbai Metro rail yard</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Painting these walls as <b>massive canvasses</b> was fundamental to
          the <b>maturation</b> of SNZ’s art practice{" "}
          <b>without compromising his innocence</b> in confronting ideas in a
          playful manner. His <b>visual vocabulary</b> reflects various{" "}
          <b>gradients</b> and <b>textures</b> from the{" "}
          <b>vastness of seas, fields</b> and <b>valleys</b> stippled with
          intricate forms of <b>flowers, butterflies, birds</b> and{" "}
          <b>people</b>. Since childhood, he was curious about{" "}
          <b>metamorphosis</b> and the <b>complete disintegration</b> that a
          butterfly goes through as it evolves from a pupa. It offered him
          flexibility growing up in{" "}
          <b>
            disintegrating and reintegrating his conviction from time to time.
          </b>

        <p>
          In <b>July 2020</b> SNZ collected his first NFT by an artist named{" "}
          <b>NFN Kalyan</b> whom he credits for playing a pivotal role in his
          creative journey. Anticipating a <b>paradigm shift</b>, words such as{" "}
          <b>
            ambition, innovation, collaboration, autonomy, longevity,
            transparency
          </b>{" "}
          and such framed the foundation for the early conversation about{" "}
          <b>decentralized creation.</b> It was also when he adopted the
          pseudonym <b>‘Snoozed Sneeze’</b> as it is medically detrimental to
          snooze a sneeze - akin to <b>withholding truth</b>. Few other human
          reactions are as genuine than a sneeze. He longs for{" "}
          <b>honest discourse </b> through his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          <b>‘Time’ </b> plays an intriguing role in the overarching
          decentralized experience and in creation. Through SNZ’s earlier work
          tokenized as NFTs, he dabbles with ideas such as the{" "}
          <b>inevitability of time </b> (<b>‘Patients of Time’ </b>- April
          2021), <b>identifying ourselves </b> (<b>‘OG SUGGA’</b> September
          2020,
          <b>‘Epigenetics’ </b>- April 2021) and{" "}
          <b>acknowledging our dissonance </b> as we spin up our webs of
          perception and find ourselves trapped in them (<b>‘RISKY BIZKITS’</b>{" "}
          - September 2020, <b>‘MiNES FOR MiNDS’</b> - December 2021).
