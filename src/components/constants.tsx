          This <b>on-chain genesis collection </b> comprises{" "}
          <b>33 butterflies </b> within their respective bubbles, oblivious to

          (PoS).

        <p>
          Each butterfly owned enables its collector to receive{" "}
          <b>future airdrops </b>
          which will be minted and stored under a separate collection on a
          InterPlanetary File System <b>(IPFS) </b>. There will be a total of{" "}
          <b>13 airdrops </b> for each genesis butterfly over <b>8 years </b>.
          This would make them a <b>total of 14 butterflies </b>, each butterfly
          representing a day in the <b>lifespan of a butterfly </b>(usually{" "}
          <b>14 days</b>).
        </p>
        <p>
          With each airdrop, the <b>pixel grid </b> that the butterfly and
          bubble are created on <b>grows larger </b>, creating a more vivid and
          denser visual, <b>allegorizing the maturation of a butterfly </b>. The
          only prerequisite to receive these airdrops is for a collector to own
          a genesis butterfly.

          {" "}
          <b>Snoozed Sneeze (SNZ) </b>, is a <b>reactionary artist </b> from
          Mumbai, India. His work largely focuses on the <b>intangible </b> as
          he adopts and aborts various ways to communicate the same. Submerged
          within white lies, he finds his most honest moments as those spent{" "}
          <b>observing, absorbing and reacting </b>
          to the world through his art. As he learned that his prospects with
          architecture and design were limited by the form of design solutions
          that were necessary for the zeitgeist, he pivoted towards art which he
          believed to be a more sincere and autonomous choice as a creator.
          Factors such as <b>scale, proportions, perspectives </b> and{" "}
          <b>materiality </b>
          informing his <b>compositions </b>, he transitioned into art over a
          few years of mural-making and street art along the{" "}
          <b>western coast </b> and a few <b>Himalayan valleys </b> in India as
          the <b>flame of democratizing art burned bright within him </b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spent a brief stint working for an NGO’s initiative called ‘Chal
          Rang De’ (translates to ‘Let us color’), painting{" "}
          <b>wall art in a slum area </b>
          and a <b>police headquarter </b> in Mumbai, as well as painting what
          was considered the{" "}
          <b>third longest wall art in India at the time (300ft x 15ft) </b>for{" "}
          <b>Reliance </b> at the <b>Mumbai Metro rail yard </b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Painting these <b>walls as massive canvases </b>. was fundamental to
          SNZ’s art practice which demanded discipline, dexterity and composure
          without compromising his innocence to confront ideas in a playful
          manner. His visual vocabulary reflects various gradients, tones and
          textures from the vastness of sea, fields and valleys stippled with
          the intricate forms of flowers, butterflies, birds and people. The{" "}
          <b>butterfly </b>
          has been a <b>recurring motif </b> in his work over the years. Since
          his childhood, he was curious about the{" "}
          <b>complete disintegration </b>
          that a butterfly went through, evolving from a caterpillar. This
          enabled him to think flexibly growing up, while he was required to
          disintegrate his conviction from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly after he collected his first NFT by an artist named{" "}
          <b>NFN Kalyan </b>
          in <b>July 2020 </b>, he returned to Mumbai. SNZ credits NFN for
          playing a pivotal role in his own creative journey. Although much of
          what we know of the NFT space now wasn’t known at the time, they
          anticipated a paradigm shift. In the early conversation around
          decentralization in creativity, words such as ambition, innovation,
          collaboration, autonomy, longevity, provenance, validation,
          transparency, power shifts and such bore lots of weight. Online
          communication in all formats emerged as the powerful tool it was, with
          the lockdowns extending indefinitely. It was also when he adopted the
          pseudonym ‘Snoozed Sneeze’ as it is medically detrimental to snooze a
          sneeze - akin to being untruthful or holding back. Few other human
          reactions are more genuine than a sneeze. He longed for{" "}
          <b>honest discourse </b> through his work.

          <b>identifying ourselves </b> (‘OG SUGGA’ September 2020,

          as we spin up our webs of perception and find ourselves trapped in
          them (‘RISKY BIZKITS’ - September 2020, ‘MiNES FOR MiNDS’ - December
          2021).
        </p>
        <p>
          SNZ finds human nature to be <b>pendulous </b> due to our ability to
          conceive numerous options in any situation, synonymous to a{" "}

            pendulum bob swinging in circular motion creating an illusion of

          when in fact we might be looping up as we remain suspended by several
          limiting forces beyond our reach. Imprisoned by our freedom of choice,
          we repeat our mistakes, trade off the pain for a bit of the pleasure
          and justify it all as we run through our mind maze.
